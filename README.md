Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

I create blog posts and open source packages mainly about vue.js and front-end.  I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that's as public as possible.

### Boy Scout Rule

I love open source.  I am not a heavy maintainer of any large libraries, but I really like the boyscout rule.  I contribute to things as I come across issues that I think other people might struggle with.  This may be things that are overlooked by someone who is deep into the library.

### My Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

I write regular blog posts, most of which you will find on my linkedin page [linkedin.com/in/shekhovtsoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shekhovtsoff/).

I write about things I am familiar with, things that trip up folks that I mentor, and things that I am learning.  Day to day I make things with **data** using **javascript**.
