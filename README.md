Frontend / Full-Stack Engineer | Vue & Nuxt Specialist | AI-First Developer | Vibecoder

I’m a Frontend Engineer with 5+ years of commercial experience, focused on building scalable, high-performance web applications, internal tools, and CRM systems. My core expertise is Vue & Nuxt, but in practice I operate as a full-stack, AI-augmented engineer.

Beyond frontend, I build real products using Flutter, Capacitor, Electron, Laravel, Node.js, and Python, allowing me to ship web, mobile, and desktop applications from a single codebase when needed.

I also have mentoring and team-leading experience, helping engineers grow, adopt modern tooling (including AI), and write cleaner, more maintainable code.

I’m deeply into vibe coding — writing expressive, readable, elegant code with flow, rhythm, and intention. I value developer experience as much as user experience. I actively use Cursor IDE and AI-assisted workflows to stay fast without sacrificing quality.
